## Running the project
i assume you have your compiler(mingw) and makefile setup on your computer. if not, you can check out https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit. 

since w64 has all the tools needed, all you can just do is type "**./make**" in your terminal to compile. then you can run "**./make run**" to run the program.
