# Image Viewer Using **SDL2**

This is a small project i made inspired by the Youtube video made by Daniel Hirsch. Ive just watch the video once. since i have sdl project in the past, why not try it. Thankfully there are ffmpeg tool to convert .jpeg to .raw rgb format.. it makes the project somewhat easy.

## Running the project
i assume you have your compiler(mingw) and makefile setup on your computer. if not, you can check out https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit. 

since w64 has all the tools needed, all you can just do is type "**./make**" in your terminal to compile. then you can run "**./make run**" to run the program.
